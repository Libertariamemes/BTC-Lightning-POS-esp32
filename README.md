# Bitcoin POS Machine with ESP32 & Lightning Network

ðŸš€ **Fast, Low-Cost, and Decentralized Bitcoin Payments**

## Overview
This project is an **open-source Bitcoin Point of Sale (POS) machine** powered by an **ESP32 microcontroller**, using the **Lightning Network** for instant and low-fee transactions. It enables merchants to accept Bitcoin payments seamlessly without relying on traditional financial institutions.

## Features
âœ… **Lightning Fast Transactions** â€“ Payments confirm instantly via the Lightning Network.  
âœ… **Low-Cost & Scalable** â€“ Near-zero fees make it ideal for small businesses.  
âœ… **WiFi Enabled** â€“ Connects to the internet via WiFi for real-time transactions.  
âœ… **QR Code Support** â€“ Generates Lightning invoices as QR codes for easy payment.  
âœ… **Capacitive Touchscreen** â€“ Smooth and responsive user interface.  
âœ… **LVGL UI** â€“ User interface powered by LVGL, with screens code-generated by EEZ Studio by Envox.  
âœ… **Standalone & Secure** â€“ Currently uses third-party Alby but can be switched to LDN as the user pleases.  
âœ… **Open-Source** â€“ Fully customizable and community-driven.

## How It Works
1. The merchant enters the amount to be paid on the ESP32-based device.
2. The device communicates with **Alby and LNbits** to generate a **Lightning invoice**.
3. The invoice is displayed as a **QR code** on the device screen.
4. The customer scans the QR code with a Lightning wallet and completes the payment.
5. The payment is verified instantly, and a confirmation message is displayed.

## Hardware Requirements
- **ESP32 microcontroller**
- **TFT Display with Capacitive Touchscreen**
- **WiFi connectivity**
- **Power source (USB or battery)**

## Software Stack
- **LVGL (Light and Versatile Graphics Library)** â€“ Used to create the user interface on the TFT display.
- **ESP32 firmware** (written in C++ using the Arduino framework)
- **Alby (third-party, currently used) and LNbits as the Lightning backend (can be switched to LDN as the user pleases)**
- **REST API / WebSockets for Lightning invoices**
- **QR Code generation library**
- **EEZ Studio by Envox** â€“ Used to code-generate the user interface screens for LVGL.

## Setup Instructions
1. Copy the contents of the "library" folder to the Arduino library folder and compile the .ino file.
2. The POS will turn on its **Access Point (AP)**. Connect your cell phone to the ESP32's network and use the web interface to configure the **WiFi credentials** and **LNbits credentials**.
3. **Alby** is always used through the **LNbits portal** for Lightning payments.
4. Deploy and start accepting Lightning payments instantly!
